# TheValley
Port of the 1982 text game "The Valley" to Linux.

This is a Linux/C++ conversion of "The Valley", a game originally written for the Commodore PET computer by Henry Budgett, Peter Freebrey, Peter Green, and Ron Harris. The PET listing was first published in the April 1982 issue of Computing Today magazine. The TRS-80 listing was published slightly later that year in the same publication.

I claim no rights to the intellectual property in this project at all, all I've done is rewrite the original basic game in C++. Based so heavily on the original I can claim no originality. Slight tweaks to make use of an 80x50 screen, the original I typed into a TRS-80 Model 1 Level 2 basic back in 1982 as 64x16 screen characters, if memory serves. Still remember fixing the typos back then :-)

Currently compiles on Ubuntu 22.04 with GCC 11.2.0, using ncurses and make.

Feel free to critique the use of "C++" - this was originally written on DOS with Borland C++ 3.1, then ported to windows, then to linux, never really structured well, just a hack. No, hang on, was it a nethack?
